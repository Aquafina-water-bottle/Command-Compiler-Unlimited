How versioning works:
    s#_#_# refers to the semantic version, which comes with their strict rules
        -this will be used for internal reference since it provides better info for the programmer compared to the public version
    v#_#_# refers to the public version, which is mostly me intrementing the major / minor / patch whenever I feel necessary
        -eg. if this program makes backwards incompatable changes that affects 0.001% of the users,
         I'll update the major in the semantic version, but I'll update either the minor or patch in the public version

s2.0.0		v0.0.0
    Mostly reorganizing a huge chunk of the pascal interpreter
        -Got a logger working
        -Things are in modules now

s3.0.0		v0.0.1
	-Added procedure declarations to the interpreter's GLOBAL_SCOPE
	-Added a bit more documentation to the overall program
	-Moved version history to its own file
	-Changed the main module from s2_0_0 to CCU so I don't have to rename my module every time I update
	-Added an error module for safe keeping
	-Change compound_statement to compound_stmt, and AST to Node because I can

s4.0.0		v0.1.0
    Mid: (Unfinished)
        -Changing the format from pascal to CCU:
            -Changed the _text.txt file to reflect the new format
            -Removed PROGRAM, and allowed the file itself to be its own program
            -Removed BEGIN / END blocks and replaced it with tab spaces
            -Removed VAR (and a specific var declarations block)
            -Changed the order of typing from "name, name: type" to "type name, type name"
            -All keywords are now case sensitive, and must be lowercase

        General changes:
            -Added a list [int, int] as position inside the file to better track errors

    Post:
