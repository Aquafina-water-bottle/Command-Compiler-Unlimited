SO this is incomplete but so far it has features like:
-Groups for indiviual command blocks
-(limited) .mcfunction support
-scoreboard shortcuts
-(not dynamic) variables as 'definitions'
-conditional command block support
-files for the parsed commands, setblock commands and combiner commands
-server support to prevent kicking the player when using combiners
-adding  'minecraft:' over certain commands if plugins are used (for combiners)
-support minecraft versions between 1.10 and 1.12
-rcon support

and assuming I do things correctly, the list of things I'm planning on adding will be in the 'main.java' class
