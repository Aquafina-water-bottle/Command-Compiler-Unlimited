**Full download will be coming shortly**

SO **this is incomplete** but so far it has features like:
* support for command blocks (groups, conditional, combiners)
* general mcfunction support (nicknames and file encapsulation visualized by number of tab spaces)
* scoreboard shortcuts
* execute shortcuts
* selector shortcuts
* (not dynamic) variables as 'definitions'
* files for the parsed commands, setblock commands and combiner commands
* server support to prevent kicking the player when using combiners
* adding 'minecraft:' over certain commands if plugins are used
* support for minecraft versions between 1.10 and 1.12
* rcon support

and assuming I do things correctly, the list of things I'm planning on adding will be in under general/main.java
