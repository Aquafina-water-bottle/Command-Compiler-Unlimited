**Suddenly Python**

tl;dr reworking literally everything about CCU. Right now, pretty much its entire name is a misnomer. No, it doesn't even support minecraft stuff yet, making "command" meaningless. No, it is not a compiler; it is an interpreter. No, the language is much more restrictive compared to before, making "unlimited" meaningless.

However, since it actually follows the conventions of actual interpreters (like having an actual tokenizer), development should be much faster.
