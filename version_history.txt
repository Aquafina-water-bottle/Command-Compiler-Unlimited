How versioning works:
    s#_#_# refers to the semantic version, which comes with their strict rules
        -this will be used for internal reference since it provides better info for the programmer compared to the public version
    v#_#_# refers to the public version, which is mostly me intrementing the major / minor / patch whenever I feel necessary
        -eg. if this program makes backwards incompatable changes that affects 0.001% of the users,
         I'll update the major in the semantic version, but I'll update either the minor or patch in the public version

s2.0.0		v0.0.0
    Mostly reorganizing a huge chunk of the pascal interpreter
        -Got a logger working
        -Things are in modules now

s3.0.0		v0.0.1
	-Added procedure declarations to the interpreter's GLOBAL_SCOPE
	-Added a bit more documentation to the overall program
	-Moved version history to its own file
	-Changed the main module from s2_0_0 to CCU so I don't have to rename my module every time I update
	-Added an error module for safe keeping
	-Change compound_statement to compound_stmt, and AST to Node because I can

s4.0.0		v0.1.0
    Mid: (Unfinished)
        -Changing the format from pascal to CCU:
            -Changed the _text.txt file to reflect the new format
            -Removed PROGRAM, and allowed the file itself to be its own program
            -Removed BEGIN / END blocks and replaced it with tab spaces
            -Removed VAR (and a specific var declarations block)
            -Changed the order of typing from "name, name: type" to "type name, type name"
            -All keywords are now case sensitive, and must be lowercase

        General changes:
            -Added a list [int, int] as position inside the file to better track errors

    Post:
        -Generally working now

s4.0.1		v0.1.1
    -Fixed a bug with "scoreboard players test", now doesn't have a random execute command

s4.1.0      v0.1.2
    -Integrated pyexpander with the program

s5.0.0      v0.1.3
    -Changed tab spaces to 4 spaces

s5.1.1      v0.2.1
    -Honestly a lot of stuff changed during this time but I forgot to record it
    -The main thing that was changed is how the shortcuts are made, since literally the entirity of interpreter.py was redone
    -Now everything is much more strict and a bit more readable and usable since it used to be almost a 
        one to one port from the old java code, which is just absolutely disgusting

    -Added the function shortcut where you can just type "function name" -> "function ego:EVENT_NAME/name"

s6.0.0      v0.3.0
    -Removed the Common, Post and Mid folders

s7.0.0      v0.4.0
    config/config.ini:
        - Added a version config option to specify "1.12" or "1.13"

            - Uses dynamic programming to cache values (maps the token class to the values)
        - Renamed a bunch of token classes to better match up with what token types they represent (Simple or Typed)

    lexical_token.py:
        - Removed a bunch of staticmethods that aren't being used anymore by the token
        - Added a cast method that assumes the type can be properly changed when used
            - Works with both token classes and token types

    token_position.py: (created)
        - Created a TokenPosition class
            - Prevents confusion between the line number and the column number of the previous representation (a tuple of two ints)

        - Created a TokenPositionRecorder class:
            - Mutable version of the TokenPosition class used in during the tokenizing process

        - Added a one liner !constobj statement to determine what objective name will be used for operations with constant numbers
            - eg. "@s _ti * 5" requires an objective for scoreboard players operation, which wiil be defined with !constobj
        - Added a command chain option by having a command end with ":" and starting as a new block -> REMOVED
            - Equivalent to CBP or CCUv1 "USE"

    mcfunction.py:
        - A simple object to hold the full path to the mcfunction and all commands as strings within it
        - Used to hold a list of Command objects, which hold a list of token objects

    TODO:
        - Allow all forms of "minecraft:"
        - Have the lexer output whitespace tokens in certain situations
        - Include type hinting as introduced by python 3.5+ (unless it requires 3.7+)
        - Look into using dataclasses or NamedTuple for various objects (eg. nodes)

        - Command line arguments:
            - Debug file only when "-dl" or "--debug-log"
            - Specify custom version under "-v" or "--version" as 1.12 or 1.13 that overrides the config specification

        - formatted and custom exceptions
        - generator for immutable struct-like classes for nodes

        1.13:
            - !blocktag, !itemtag, !functiontag, !fluidtag
            - Change format of execute commands to use ":" and all sub execute commands
            - mcfunction format in datapacks (different namespace)
            - general change in file system
