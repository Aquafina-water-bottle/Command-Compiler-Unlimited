How versioning works:
    s#_#_# refers to the semantic version, which comes with their strict rules

    v#_#_# refers to the public version, which is mostly me intrementing the major / minor / patch whenever I feel necessary
        -eg. if this program makes backwards incompatable changes that affects 0.001% of the users,
         I'll update the major in the semantic version, but I'll update either the minor or patch in the public version

	-Added an error module for safe keeping
	-Change compound_statement to compound_stmt, and AST to Node because I can
